I am a Master's Student in <a href=''>Electrical and Computer Engineering - Machine Learning, Communications, and Security</a> at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, working in the <a href='https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/research/labs/information-processing-ltci/teams/digital-communications'>Mathematics of Information & Communication Group</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.tchamkerten.com/'>Prof. Aslan Tchamkerten</a>. Prior to that, I received my BSc from Sharif University in Electrical Engineering.

My research interests include **Information Theory** and **Machine Learning**, where I focus on providing fundamental limitations on the Machine Learning algorithms using information theory.
